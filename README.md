# caltrain-node
Quick and dirty implementation to query caltrain schedule from 511.org
I am working on a heroku app, and need to share this between multiple apps. I am not really proud of my implementation, and tests
are completely meaningless right now. Would probably fix those, once my downstream dependencies are defined.
